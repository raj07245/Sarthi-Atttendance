# Sarthi-Atttendance
Production-ready AI Face Recognition Attendance System built using Spring Boot microservices and Python. Designed as a scalable SaaS platform for schools and enterprises.

An AI-powered Face Recognition Attendance System built for real-world usage in schools, colleges, and organizations.

This project is designed as a scalable SaaS platform where institutions can automate attendance using computer vision — eliminating manual registers, proxies, and time-consuming processes.

✅ AI Face Recognition for automatic attendance  
✅ Multi-user system with secure JWT authentication  
✅ Spring Boot backend for scalable APIs  
✅ Python microservice for high-speed face detection  
✅ REST-based communication between services  
✅ Proxy attendance prevention  
✅ Designed for multi-organization SaaS architecture  
✅ Real-time attendance tracking

Attendance Marked in Database

Backend: Spring Boot, Java  
AI Engine: Python, OpenCV, face_recognition  
Security: JWT Authentication  
Database: (Write your DB — MySQL / PostgreSQL)  
Architecture: Microservices-based  

The goal of this project is to evolve into a full-scale AI Attendance SaaS product that can be used by thousands of institutions.

Future plans include:

• Multi-tenant architecture  
• Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)  
• Docker containerization  
• Admin analytics dashboard  
• Mobile support  
• AI insights on attendance patterns  

⚠️ Currently in active development.

New features and optimizations are continuously being added to improve accuracy, speed, and scalability.

Most attendance systems are outdated and prone to manipulation.

This system leverages Artificial Intelligence to create a fast, secure, and tamper-resistant attendance infrastructure for modern institutions.

• Live camera classroom detection  
• Edge-device deployment  
• Voice-enabled attendance  
• Emotion-aware analytics  
• Complete institution management ecosystem  

Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome!
